/// **Order Matters With Gestures**
///
/// The order of the gestures matters, as they are attached to the RealityView.
///
/// The reason why order matters is that some gestures can be considered part of other gestures.
/// For instance, if you add a drag gesture for an entity followed by a tap gesture for that same
/// entity, it won't probably work the way you expect.
/// The drag gesture will capture the tap as part of recognizing the drag gesture, meaning that the
/// tap actions will go unexecuted or be executed at weird times.
///
/// ** Rotation With Drag Along the X-axis **
///
/// In our example above, dragging left or right on the earth causes it to spin around the Y-axis.
/// In this implementation, we need some math to know whether we are dragging left or right.
///
/// In order to know whether you are dragging left or right you need to keep track of:
///
/// 1. `entityDragLastLocation.x`: Where you _were_ along the x-axis.
///
/// 2. `entity.location.x`: Where you _are_ along the x-axis.
///
/// In other word, each frame, you need to keep track of the `deltaXTranslation = entity.location.x - entityDragLastLocation`.
///
/// We add two new @State variable within the view's scope:
///
/// ```swift
/// @State var private earthRotationY: Angle = .zero
/// @State var private earthLastDragLocation: CGPoint = .zero
/// ```
///
/// `earthRotationY` tracks the current number of degrees the earth is rotated, and it's initialized to 0 degrees.
///
/// With `earthDragLastLocation`, you store a (x, y, z) point representing the position of where the drag gesture last ended.
///
/// Let's implement the following code to have this work. Supposing that the entity we want to rotate is the `earth` entity.
///
/// ```swift
/// .gesture(
///     DragGesture()
///         .targetedToEntity(earth)
///         .onChanged { value in
///             var deltaXDrag = value.location.x - earthDragLastLocation
///
///             if (earth.position(relativeTo: nil).x > 0) {
///                 deltaXDrag = -deltaXDrag
///             }
///
///             if deltaXDrag > 0 {
///                 earthRotationY += .degrees(5.0)
///             }
///
///             if deltaXDrag < 0 {
///                 earthRotationY -= .degrees(5.0)
///             }
///
///             earthDragLastLocation = value.location
///
///             earth.orientation = simd_quatf(
///                 angle: Float(earthRotationY.radians),
///                 axis: SIMD<Float>(0, 1, 0)
///             )
///         }
/// )
/// ```
///
/// As you notice, the gesture is targeted to the `earth` entity.
/// As per its drag gesture, we need to write our code in the body of the function that gets passed to the
/// `onChanged()` method/event, since, in the `onChanged` event gesture modifier, its passed-over closure gets
/// executed upon recognizing the user's drag movement per frame. That gives you the ability to animate and change
/// directions before the gesture has even finished.
///
/// We then create an `deltaXDrag`, which represents the amount of change in the x coordinate from the current drag location
/// `value.location.x` to the previous location `earthDragLastLocation.x` (which is initialized to 0).
///
/// The current location of the drag is accessed via the `value` parameter provided to the action.
///
/// If you drag to the right, `deltaXDrag` is always positive (a larger number minus a smaller number); however, when
/// dragging to the left, `deltaXDrag` is always negative (a smaller number minus a larger number).
///
/// Keep in mind that those numbers are relative to the earth entity itself.
///
/// We then use two if statements to check to see if `deltaXDrag` is positive, and if so, we increment `earthRotationY.degrees`
/// by 5.0. If `deltaXDrag` is negative, we decrement `earthRotationY.degrees` by 5.0.
///
/// Once completed, we obviously update `earthDragLastLocation` to be the current drag location (value.location), since we
/// want to make sure that `deltaXDrag` is always representing the change with respect to the user's last drag location, instead
/// of relying on a static reference point. That makes sure that we dynamically keep track of the change in x and it's the most
/// accurate delta possible.
///
/// However, an interesting part of the code is the following:
///
/// if (earth.position(relativeTo: nil).x > 0) {
///     deltaXChange = -deltaXChange
/// }
///
/// That code above takes into account the situation in which we are rotating the entire RealityView around the Y axis.
/// In such a case, the earth might end up on the right side of the sun (the center of the RealityView's rotation).
///
/// That keeps track of whether the position of the `earth` entity is in the quadrant of the positive x's with
/// respect to the frame of reference of the immersive space/Volumetric Window (relativeTo: nil). If so, it means that
/// the `earth` entity's local frame of reference is now rotated around the Y axis, which also means that the positive direction
/// which the X axis is pointing towards got inverted. That entails the value of the drag amount being negative when dragging
/// to the right, and positive when dragging to the left.
///
/// In such a situation, we need to negate the `deltaXChange` to keep that X axis inversion into account (`deltaXChange = -deltaXChange`); that way, the comparison still worksÂ â€”Â even with the entire RealityView reversed.
///
/// **Note:** The earth rotation in response to the drag gesture still works when the earth is scaled; using the
/// properties on the `transform` object doesn't reset any other properties you've set.
///
///
/// RealityView Rotation with Drag
///
/// When it comes to rotating the RealityView when dragging the entity positioned at its center, there's no need to check
/// whether same entity's position relative to the view to see if its position got reversed with respect to the view's center.
/// That's because that entity is positioned at the center of the view itself, and a rotation of the view itself won't affect it.
///
/// We require the `minimumDistance` parameter's value of the `DragGesture` â€”Â upon its initialization â€” to be 1.0, to avoid
/// accidental drag recognition.
///
/// Additionally, a `coordinateSpace` parameter is set to `.global` (the default is `.local`).
/// This forces the gesture to be considered with respect to the global coordinate space (frame of reference) at the root of
/// the view hierarchy.
///
/// If you were to leave out the `coordinateSpace` parameterÂ â€”Â which means to set it to the `.local` default â€”Â the gesture
/// will be considered with respect to the local frame of reference, which is the coordinate space of the entity itself.
/// In our example, the sun scene's coordinate system. However, because the sun scene's coordinate system itself is changing,
/// you would have that, each time, the x component of the position vector for the drag's location will then start changing
/// as well, since the position vector keeps getting expressed with respect to a changing coordinate system; precisely, the
/// vector's x component will start decreasing as the angle grows above zero degrees, you will then have a negative deltaX,
/// which will, in turn, as you keep dragging, increase the vector's x component back by a slight value
/// causing a positive deltaX, which will, again, decrease the vector's x component, and you'll get into a loop as you keep
/// dragging, which will make your rotation blocked.
///
/// However, by expressing the vector position for the drag location with respect to the global coordinate system, which does
/// not vary, you avoid this problem.
